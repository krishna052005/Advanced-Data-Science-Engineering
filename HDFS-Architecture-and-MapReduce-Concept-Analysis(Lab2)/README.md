# HDFS Architecture and MapReduce Concept Analysis (Lab Experiment 2)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and demonstrating the working of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce programming concepts. The experiment is conducted as part of the Applied Data Science Engineering Laboratory and emphasizes conceptual clarity without actual Hadoop execution.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To analyze and demonstrate the HDFS architecture and commands, and to interpret MapReduce concepts and job outputs without program execution.

---

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- NameNode and DataNode architecture
- HDFS replication and fault tolerance
- MapReduce programming model
- Map, Shuffle & Sort, Reduce phases
- Key–Value pair processing
- MapReduce job output and logs interpretation

---

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Performed

### 1. HDFS Directory Structure Creation
- Designed hierarchical HDFS directory structure
- Organized input and output directories for MapReduce jobs

### 2. HDFS Command Analysis
- Studied common HDFS commands such as:
  - mkdir, put, ls, cat, du, rm
- Understood file management in a distributed environment

### 3. MapReduce Program Interpretation
- Interpreted a character frequency problem using MapReduce logic
- Simulated Map and Reduce phases using efficient Python code
- Demonstrated key–value generation and aggregation

### 4. Shuffle, Sort, and Reduce Analysis
- Explained intermediate key grouping
- Analyzed reducer-level aggregation behavior

### 5. MapReduce Job Output & Log Analysis
- Interpreted final output format
- Analyzed MapReduce job execution flow using logs
